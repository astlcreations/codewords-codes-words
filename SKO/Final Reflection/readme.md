# ✩✩✩ Final Thoughts & Reflection ✩✩✩

**Wow, this course has been an absolute journey for me.** I’ve had big highs, big lows and heaps of confusion in between (as depicted simpliy below). Though in the end I am so happy that I decided to take on the challenges that come with the wonderous world of coding. I mentioned it in Week #1, but coding has been something that I have wanted to explore for a long time and this course was the perfect chance for me to really dive into that new skill. I think the biggest thing that I loved from this was learning about the amazing works that people have done with coding, from websites to fonts and even games. I knew the community was big and creative, but I think it was just an eye opener that you really can do anything with these programs (or close to it at least). It has given me a big inspiration into the things that I can do with digital materials alongside my skills with drawing, painting etc. But of course, I’m super proud of myself to learning the basics of p5.js! Though I’m not a professional yet, I have the ability to make a things exist through the program, which is an amazing step for me!

**Do I think I will continue with coding in my design practice?** I’m not 100% sure about that one, but I know that going through this course has inspired me to challenge my skills in design. What I have learnt with coding is something I will always have with me, and it’s nice to know that I have the basics to explore more of it if I wanted to. Though I think for now I need to find a nice balance between the design I love to do and the pairing between that. So, in the end, thank you for having me Codewords!! It has been an absolute pleasure.
