# Assessment Task 1: Student Knowledge Object

For this task you will create and maintain a wiki-page on your personal Github (Links to an external site.) for the duration of the course. Your wiki will become a living document which can contain any mixture of the following elements:

- New words (and their definitions)
- Snippets of critical theory and readings (with citations!)
- Links to relevant resources on the web (keep these annotated so you remember what they are and why you saved them)
- Methods and techniques for coding (remember to use the insert code markdown so the code will appear correctly, it looks like this < > )
- Anything else you find useful or interesting in the course.
*Don't worry you can keep editing and improving your wiki each week. But we will be checking in often, so please don't leave everything to the last minute!*

**What do I deliver for this task?**
A URL for your Github Wiki-page.
You will finish your wiki by adding a foreword of max. 500 words. This text will be a reflective statement on your learning experiences throughout the course. There will be a dedicated workshop for this step.

**When do I deliver this task?**
The deadline for this task is in Week 13. Note that we will be checking in often and using your wiki as a resource during the course, so do NOT leave this task to the last minute.

20% Planning - How have you organised and managed your wiki?
40% Reflection - This part of the rubric measures the context you provide your content, including the final critical piece of reflective writing (max 500 words). What have you learned from what you documented?
40% Research - This measures the quality and quantity of the materials you documented in your wiki over the duration of the course. How relevant and valuable is the content?

**What will I learn through this task?**
Methodologies for capturing, organising and managing new knowledge and practice.
Critical thinking through detailed documentation of your experiences.
Critical writing methods (how to articulate your ideas).
