# Week #2: Modular Typefaces and Scary GitHub

Today was another day of exploring ideas and being introduced to new slightly confusing programs. In the morning we spent some time exploring Modular typefaces from other designers as possible inspiration for our final FINAL projects. I ended up finding this one by a Canadian designer called Marian Bantjes which she designed for her own documentary credit sequence. Essentially, I love how its slightly animated and as the different people are being credited the words change slightly while the structure is still beautifully stagnant. Bantjes’s work reminds me of a quilted blanket which is a big inspiration as I would love to explore mediums within the project that aren’t just digital.

In the second half of the day we explored the wonderful exciting place that is GitHub!! Now at this point I thought I had some kind of idea what was happening but after exploring Github I got completely lost. I’m sure I just need to spend some more time getting acquainted with the program and how it works but I won’t lie in saying that I felt very out of my comfort zone. But that’s okay, I’m actually excited about that! Because it means I can actually work on something that is different than what I normally do, so get ready GitHub you’re going to have some amazing stuff happening from me! And I got excited playing with the new coding program and created both my initials in a little web format. We all shared our initials and the were asked to remix another persons design so I took Taj's T and made it a funky 3D design.

We also finalised our groups for the Re-Readings project and what games we would be working with. The goal is to recreate a section of the text “House of Leaves” using our video game of choice, for my group I was with Tom and Ziyun using Minecraft. I was super excited about the section we picked too which was Section 6 in the Navderson Report. The section focuses on the pets within the house and I’m excited to explore how that’s really the only presence of animals that the film focuses on within the report. Let’s see how it goes!
