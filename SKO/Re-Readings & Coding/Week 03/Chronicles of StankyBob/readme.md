You are StankyBob, a survivor trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a backpack and a canteen. You haven't eaten in two days so you're desperately searching for food. You enter a rundown building and can tell that the people were wiped out here. You find several guns and take ammo for them, even though it's mostly just in case you find another group of people that need taking care of.

> You search the area.
You search the building and find more guns, unfortunately all of them loaded. You don't have the means to re-load them. You are about to give up when you find a trapdoor in the floor.

> You open trapdoor.
You open the trapdoor and find a storage room with a bunch of food bags hanging from the ceiling. You grin from ear to ear.

> You explore storage room.
You find even more food bags. You unzip one and find them full of candy bars and other granola bars. Mmmm, granola bars...
You hear a noise from above and grab a gun.

> You listen for noise.
You stand perfectly still and try to hear over the sound of your own heart pounding in your ears. After a few moments you hear it again, a light creaking sound.

> You close trapdoor.
You shut the trapdoor and keep searching, eventually you find a door on the other side of the room.

> You take food and go through door.
You open the door and find yourself in a bathroom. You don't find anything useful there so you leave.
You have found a storage room and a bathroom.

> You listen for noise again.
You stand perfectly still and listen for noise again. After a few moments you hear it again, a light creaking sound.
You close the door.

> You yell out.
You run to the door and yell to see if anyone is in the building.
Nobody responds. You are about to ask again when you realize that might not be a great idea.

> You open trapdoor.
You open the trapdoor and find a pile of rubble and debris at the base. You jump down and start trying to move the rocks when you hear a noise from above.

> You go to noise.
You go up to the trapdoor and listen for the noise again. You can hear something, but it's very faint. Your ears start popping and you realize you need to be careful about what you hear.
You go back to work on the pile of rubble and debris. After a few moments you hear the noise again. You ignore it the first time. The second time, you think you can just make out a word or two.

> You listen to the noise.
You go and listen to the noise again.
This time you understand what you are hearing. It sounds like voices, and they sound very far away.
You go back to work.

> You gather food.
You decide to leave and come back with a friend or help.
You have collected:
A fully-loaded handgun A large knife A canteen A radio A medikit A flashlight, and...
Suddenly you realize there is a small opening in the pile of rubble and debris you are hiding behind.
You look around for something to clear out the hole but see nothing.

> You use hands to clear the hole.
You start putting your hands into the small hole and start trying to shove whatever you can find into it. You are just starting to shove some of your clothing in when you hear the noise again.

> You listen to the noise.
This time the noise is louder and you can tell it's coming from above you.
You look up and see something hanging from the roof. It looks like a large bag with a light on top.

> You get closer to bag on the roof.
You realize that the bag on the roof contains food and water, and you need it more than ever.
You run toward the building,almost slipping a few times on the muddy ground.

> You examine area.
As you make your way to the store,you notice it is just a simple wooden building with a tin roof.
You notice there is a pile of rubble and debris to the right of the building. You make your way past it and into the store.
You look around but don't see anyone. Then you notice some footprints leading away from a shelf and toward a back room.
You decide to follow them.

> You equip gun and open door.
You walk in to find a man with a shaved head wearing red pants and sitting in front of a computer.
He looks at you and smiles before saying "Ah, fresh meat! It's time to play!"
You are confused by this but decide to ask questions later.
He stands up and says "I am Blood Web, the town sheriff! And you are?"
"I'm..."

> You introduce yourself.
"I'm... uh..."
"Don't bother lying, you are the guys who killed Hans Hirsch and took his place!"

> You say "I dont know what youre talking about"
He slaps you in the face
"Don't play dumb with me m'boy! You're part of a gang that raids houses and takes valuables. You've killed at least 2 men so far."

> You say "I'm sorry"
He slaps you in the face again
"We don't want your apologies! We want your valuables."
You look around and see a few items that might be worth something.

> You say "I'm doing what i need to protect myself, so let me go"
He slaps you in the face again
"No! You're going to give us your valuables!"
You look at him and then to the table and see some firearms.
threaten blood web with gun
You pull out your gun and point it at Blood Web. He looks terrified.
"Oh no...", he says as he tries to think of a plan.

> You say "give me the guns and ill be on my way"
"Ha ha! What a stupid idea. No! You're going to give us the valuables or I'm going to hurt you really bad."
You grab him by the throat and begin to strangle him.

> You say "GIVE ME YOUR GUNS"
He gives you the guns and you take them.
You leave the store and walk back to your campsite.
You have learned: You need better equipment to make money quickly.
